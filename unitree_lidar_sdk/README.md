# Unitree Lidar SDK

## Introduction
This package is a cmake package, which is specially used for running `Unitree LiDAR L1`.

The functions that this package can provide includes:
- Parse the raw data transmitted from the lidar hardware, and convert it into pointcloud and IMU data
- Get the pointcloud data
- Get the IMU data

The output pointcloud defaultly uses a self-defined data type so that this SDK doesn't rely too much on external dependencies. In other case,
- if you are used to use [Point Cloud Library](https://pointclouds.org/), you can use the header `unitree_lidar_sdk_pcl.h` to transform our pointcloud to PCL format;
- if you wish to directly use a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) package, you are also able to utilize our ROS pacakge for this lidar.

## Dependency
We have verified that this package can successfully run under this environment:
- `Ubuntu 20.04` 

This SDK hardly depends on any external dependencies.
But if you want to use PCL cloud format, you need to install one. 

## Configure

Connect your lidar to your computer with a USB cable, then confirm your serial port name for lidar:
```
$ ls /dev/ttyUSB*
/dev/ttyUSB0
```

The default serial port name is `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
If it is not the default one, you need to modify the configuration parameter in `example_lidar.cpp`.

## Build

You can build this program as a cmake project:
```
cd unitree_lidar_sdk

mkdir build

cd build

cmake .. && make -j2
```

## Run
Directly run the example:
```
../bin/example_lidar
```

The output is like this:
```
$ ../bin/example_lidar

lidar sdk version = 1.0.3

```

Here, we print the first 10 points of the pointcloud message and the quaternion of the IMU message.

**Notice**:
- In Ubuntu, accessing a serial port device requires the appropriate permissions. If your C++ program does not have sufficient permissions to access the serial port device, you will get a **"Permission denied"** error.
- To solve this error, you can use the following command to add the current user to the dialout group:
```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```
- After adding the user to the dialout group, you need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
